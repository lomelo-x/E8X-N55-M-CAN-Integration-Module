In order to use MHD to write the modified program section back to the ECU the CRC checksum at 0x80304 must be corrected.
When flashing in MHD a Long Write must be initiated. Check/Uncheck MT Shift Bog Fix for example.


1. Make the required modifications to the bin file.

2. Rename to "input.bin" and place in the same folder as "csprogram-windows.exe"

3. Run "csprogram-windows.exe". Map and Program checksums will be corrected automatically.
