# E9X-M-CAN-Integration-Module
 
I designed this module to integrate additional functionality into my '08 E92 335i.
With full access to the K-CAN, PT-CAN and D-CAN, functionality can be added, modified or suppressed. This enables the use of FXX modules and radios, MDrive and more.
While the code is quite specific for my particular car, much of the CAN message logic may be useful.
Included are also tools to allow full manipulation of the program section in the MSD81 bin file.

**Program:**

Message transmission is optimized to reach the receiver module on the shortest route. I.e. messages that need to reach KOMBI are sent on K-CAN even if the BMW implementation would have sent it over PT-CAN. This is done to bypass any gateway (JBE) delays.
Functions that make use of CANID 0x6F1 (iDrive volume, SVT_70 gateway, etc.) are deactivated if communication on D-CAN from an OBD tool is detected.
FiFo queues are implemented to ensure reading and processing of messages is not blocked by delays.
A serial interface with a set of commands is implemented to allow manipulation during runtime. The default password to unlock it is "coldboot". "help" prints the available commands.


**Arduino IDE settings:**

Board: Teensy 4.0  
Optimize: Faster with LTO  
CPU Speed: 396 MHz  
USB Type: Single for normal operation, Dual for serial status and Triple Serial for CAN USB interface,   


To make some startup time critical functions work, the following changes should be made to startup.c:  
(Linux path: /home/**Username**/.arduino15/packages/teensy/hardware/avr/**Version**/cores/teensy4/startup.c)  
Comment these lines:  
	usb_pll_start();  
	while (millis() < TEENSY_INIT_USB_DELAY_BEFORE) ;  
	usb_init();  
	while (millis() < TEENSY_INIT_USB_DELAY_AFTER + TEENSY_INIT_USB_DELAY_BEFORE) ; // wait  
  
Optionally, modify usb.c:  
Comment:  
	delay(25);  



**MSD81 IKM0S binary modification:**

[PROGRAM]

0x83738   and  0x83739  -> 1F 03      (CAN message table)  
0x1F3AD4  and  0x1F3AD5 -> 1F 03      (CAN filters)  

Replace 15 03 (0x315 represented in Little Endian) to stop MSD81 from reacting to Vehicle Mode changes (triggered by JBBF through EDC button).  
This also allows state_spt (throttle map) to be controlled independently from the main "MDrive" with the console switch.  
Alternatively, this XDF contains definitions for the CAN IDs: https://github.com/superwofy/Superwofy-IKM0S-XDF.  
Re-calculate checksum at 0x80304 using csprogram-windows.exe.  



[MAP]

lc_var_spt_swi at 0x4CD1D set to 00. This disables the DME 1M MDrive logic. 0x399, 0x1D9 etc.  
By default the DME hard-codes the MDrive values for Servotronic, EDC etc. In order to replace them, these functions need to be disabled.
